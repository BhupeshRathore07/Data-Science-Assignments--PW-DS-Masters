    "Ans: The purpose of grid search cv in machine learning is to find the best hyperparameters for a given model. It works by exhaustively searching a specified parameter space to find the combination of hyperparameters that results in the best model performance."

    "Ans: Grid search cv exhaustively searches the entire parameter space, while randomized search cv samples a specified number of random parameter combinations. Grid search cv is typically used when the parameter space is small and can be exhaustively searched, while randomized search cv is useful when the parameter space is large and needs to be sampled."

    "Ans: **Data leakage** occurs when information from the test set is inadvertently leaked into the training set, leading to overly optimistic model performance. An example of data leakage is when a feature in the test set is derived from the target variable, such as calculating the average value of the target variable for each category of a categorical variable, and this feature is used in the model."

    "Ans: To prevent data leakage, the test set should be completely isolated from the training process. This can be achieved by splitting the data into training and test sets before any preprocessing or feature engineering is performed, and by using cross-validation to evaluate model performance during hyperparameter tuning."
