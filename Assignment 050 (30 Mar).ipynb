    "Ans: **Elastic Net Regression** is a regularization technique that combines the strengths of both Ridge and Lasso Regression. It addresses the limitations of both methods and can be used for high-dimensional datasets with multicollinearity. The Elastic Net Regression adds both L1 and L2 regularization penalties to the loss function, which helps to overcome the overfitting and feature selection problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression can perform better in situations where there are multiple correlated features. Compared to Lasso Regression, it can handle situations where the number of features is greater than the number of observations, as it allows for a more flexible penalty term."

    "Ans: In machine learning, the purpose of pickling a model is to save the trained model to disk so that it can be used later for predictions or further training, without having to retrain the model from scratch every time it is needed. Pickling a model allows us to serialize the model object and store it in a file, which can be loaded later to reconstruct the model and use it for making predictions on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful in situations where the model training takes a long time or requires significant computational resources. Pickling allows us to save the model state and reload it later, making it easier to reuse and share the model with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to pickling the model itself, it is also possible to pickle other objects related to the model, such as data preprocessing steps or feature engineering pipelines, allowing us to reproduce the entire modeling pipeline when needed."
