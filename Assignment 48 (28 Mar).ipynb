    "Ans: **Ridge Regression** is a regularized linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the least squares objective function. \n",
    "This penalty term, known as the L2 regularization term, is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's coefficient values. This penalty term shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, thereby reducing the variance of the regression estimates. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, ordinary least squares regression does not include any penalty term and simply finds the coefficients that minimize the sum of the squared errors between the predicted and actual values. This can result in overfitting and large coefficient values, particularly when there are many correlated predictors."
