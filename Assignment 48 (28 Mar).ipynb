    "Ans: **Ridge Regression** is a regularized linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the least squares objective function. This penalty term shrinks the regression coefficients towards zero, thereby reducing the variance of the regression estimates. It differs from ordinary least squares regression by adding a regularization term to the objective function."
