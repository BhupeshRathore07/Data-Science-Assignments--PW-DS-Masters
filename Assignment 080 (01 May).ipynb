    "- A `contingency matrix`, also known as a confusion matrix or an error matrix, is a table that presents the performance of a classification model by comparing predicted labels with the actual labels of a dataset. It is commonly used to evaluate the performance of a classification model in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The contingency matrix has rows representing the actual labels and columns representing the predicted labels. Each cell in the matrix indicates the number of instances that belong to a particular combination of actual and predicted labels. It provides a summary of how well the model is performing in terms of correctly and incorrectly classified instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The contingency matrix enables the calculation of various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and others, which provide insights into the model's performance in different aspects like overall correctness, true positive rate, false positive rate, etc."

    "Ans: A `pair confusion matrix` is a specialized form of confusion matrix that focuses on pairwise relationships between classes. It is particularly useful in situations where the classification task involves pairwise comparisons or ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a `regular confusion matrix`, the rows and columns represent the classes or labels in the dataset. Each cell contains the count or percentage of instances belonging to a specific combination of true and predicted labels. However, a pair confusion matrix focuses on the relationships between pairs of classes.\n",

    "- The pair confusion matrix provides a more detailed view of the model's performance by explicitly showing the confusion patterns between specific pairs of classes. \n",
    "- It can be used to analyze the specific errors or confusions that occur between particular classes, which may be of interest in certain applications. \n",
    "- For example, in binary classification tasks, it can help identify cases where one class is consistently confused with the other."

    "Ans: **Extrinsic measures** focus on evaluating the effectiveness of a language model in solving a specific task rather than assessing its inherent language generation capabilities. These measures consider the performance of the language model within a broader system or application, taking into account the specific requirements and objectives of that application.\n",

    "For example, in machine translation, an extrinsic measure could be the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score, which evaluates the quality of translated sentences by comparing them to reference translations. In sentiment analysis, the accuracy of sentiment classification on a labeled dataset can be an extrinsic measure.\n",

They offer insights into the model's effectiveness and usefulness for specific applications, helping researchers and practitioners make informed decisions about the deployment and improvement of language models."

    "Ans: In the context of machine learning, an **intrinsic measure** is a type of evaluation metric used to assess the performance of a model based on its internal characteristics or properties. It focuses on evaluating the model's performance independent of any specific downstream task or real-world application.\n",

    "Unlike extrinsic measures, which evaluate the model based on its performance in a specific task, intrinsic measures assess the model's inherent capabilities, such as its ability to generalize, capture patterns, or learn meaningful representations from the data. These measures provide insights into the model's performance on the training data and its behavior in the absence of a specific application context.\n",

These measures provide a quantitative assessment of the model's performance in predicting the correct labels or making accurate predictions within the training data."

    "Ans: Using accuracy as a sole evaluation metric for classification tasks has some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imbalanced classes:** Accuracy alone may not reflect the performance on imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the data. A high accuracy can be misleading if the model is biased toward the majority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Different misclassification costs:** Accuracy treats all misclassifications equally, but misclassifying certain classes may have more severe consequences. It is important to consider the specific costs associated with different types of errors and evaluate metrics like precision, recall, or F1 score, which provide a more nuanced assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignoring confidence or probability:** Accuracy does not consider the confidence or probability associated with predictions. Models that output probability estimates can be better evaluated using metrics like log loss or area under the ROC curve (AUC) that capture the confidence level of predictions."
