    "Ans: **Linear regression** is used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables, whereas logistic regression is used to model the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Logistic regression is more appropriate when the response variable is binary, such as predicting whether a customer will churn or not, or whether an email is spam or not."

    "Ans: The **cost function** used in logistic regression is the log-loss function, which measures the error between the predicted and actual values of the binary response variable. The optimization is done using iterative techniques such as gradient descent to find the optimal set of coefficients that minimize the log-loss function."

    "Ans:  Imbalanced datasets in logistic regression occur when the number of observations in one class is much higher than the other class. This can lead to biased models that are not able to predict the minority class well. Strategies for dealing with class imbalance include oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, or using techniques such as SMOTE to generate synthetic samples of the minority class."

    "Ans: Common issues and challenges that may arise when implementing logistic regression include multicollinearity among the independent variables, which can be addressed by removing correlated variables or using regularization techniques such as Ridge or Lasso regression. Other issues include outliers, missing data, and non-linearity of the relationship between the independent variables and the response variable. These can be addressed through appropriate data cleaning, imputation, and transformation techniques."
