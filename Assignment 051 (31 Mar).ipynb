    "Ans: **Traditional web hosting** typically involves leasing a physical server or dedicated space in a data center from a hosting provider. The server is maintained by the hosting provider, and the website owner is responsible for uploading and managing their website files on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud hosting** on the other hand, involves hosting a website on a network of virtual servers that are managed by a cloud computing provider. The website owner pays for the resources they use, such as storage and bandwidth, and can easily scale up or down their hosting plan based on their needs. Cloud hosting offers greater flexibility and scalability than traditional hosting, as well as more advanced features such as load balancing and automatic backups."

This involves creating a function in the web application that loads the saved model and applies it to the input data entered by the user. The output from the model can then be displayed on the user interface."
