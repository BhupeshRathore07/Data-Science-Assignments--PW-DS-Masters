    "\n",
    "1. **Smaller epsilon:** If epsilon is set too small, the algorithm may consider many points as noise or outliers. It can result in fragmented clusters and miss capturing larger anomalous regions that extend beyond the specified epsilon distance. Anomalies that are far apart from each other may not be identified as anomalies if epsilon is too small.\n",
