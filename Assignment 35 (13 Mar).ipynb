If the test reveals that Method A has a significantly higher mean than Methods B and C, while Methods B and C do not differ significantly from each other, the researcher can conclude that Method A is the most effective teaching method."

    "#### Q12. A researcher wants to know if there are any significant differences in the average daily sales of three retail stores: Store A, Store B, and Store C. They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store on those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in sales between the three stores. If the results are significant, follow up with a post-hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other."
