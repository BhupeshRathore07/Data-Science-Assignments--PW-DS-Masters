Additionally, it may not work well with datasets that have a high number of features or a low number of samples. Finally, it relies solely on statistical measures and does not take into account the predictive power of the features."

    "Ans: To select the most relevant attributes for the predictive model of customer churn, the Filter Method can be employed. This involves calculating the correlation of each attribute with the target variable (churn) and selecting the ones with the highest correlation coefficients. Alternatively, statistical tests like ANOVA or chi-squared can also be used to evaluate the relevance of attributes. Once the most pertinent features are selected, they can be used to train the predictive model."

    "Ans: Embedded feature selection methods work by integrating feature selection into the model training process. \n",
    "\n",
    "One common technique for embedded feature selection is regularization, where a penalty term is added to the loss function to discourage the model from relying on certain features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: Lasso regression uses L1 regularization, which can shrink the coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively removing them from the model. To use embedded feature selection for the soccer match prediction project, one could train a regularized regression model such as Lasso or Ridge and use the resulting coefficients as a measure of feature importance. The features with the highest coefficients could then be selected for use in the final model."
