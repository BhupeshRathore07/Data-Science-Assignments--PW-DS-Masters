This is because there are multiple categories within each categorical feature, and each category is not inherently ordered or ranked. One-hot encoding would create new columns for each category, where a 1 would be placed in the corresponding column for each row that contains that category, and 0s would be placed in all other columns. This allows the machine learning algorithm to recognize and analyze the categorical data as separate entities rather than as a continuous variable."
