    "Ans: In **unsupervised anomaly detection**, labeled examples of anomalies are not provided during training. The algorithm learns the normal patterns and structures from the unlabeled data and identifies instances that deviate significantly from the learned norm as anomalies. Unsupervised methods do not require prior knowledge or labels, making them more flexible but potentially less accurate in identifying anomalies.\n",

The algorithm learns to distinguish between normal and anomalous instances based on the provided labels.

However, they require a labeled training set, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain."
