    "- **Advantages** of using diverse base learners: Ensemble methods tend to work best when the individual models are diverse and complementary to each other. By using different types of base learners (e.g., decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines), bagging can increase the diversity of the ensemble and potentially improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Disadvantages** of using diverse base learners: Using different types of base learners can also introduce additional complexity and computational cost, as each learner may require different preprocessing or hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, some base learners may not work well with bagging, as they may already have built-in mechanisms to reduce overfitting (e.g., regularized linear models)."
